# Midnight Prowler

A fast-paced, first-person shooter built with a custom raycasting engine in JavaScript. Dive into a dark, maze-like world and fend off monstrous creatures with your powerful fireballs.

This project is an exercise in creating a 3D-like experience using 2D canvas rendering techniques, with a focus on performance and minimal dependencies.

## Features

*   **Custom Raycasting Engine**: Renders a 3D world on a 2D canvas, complete with dynamic lighting and sprite rendering.
*   **Procedural Audio**: All sound effects, from explosions to enemy attacks, are generated on-the-fly using the Web Audio API, keeping the project size incredibly small.
*   **Dynamic Lighting**: Fireballs illuminate the environment, casting light on walls and enemies.
*   **Sprite-based Enemies**: Monsters are rendered as 2D sprites within the 3D world, with basic animations for movement and attacks.
*   **Interactive UI**: Includes a real-time minimap, health display, and crosshair.

## Gameplay

Navigate through a dark, labyrinthine map. Your goal is to survive and eliminate all the monstrous black cats that hunt you in the shadows. Use your fireball attack to defeat them before they overwhelm you.
